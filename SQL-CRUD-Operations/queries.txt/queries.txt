#Step 1: Create the Table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER,
    course TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


#Step 2: Insert Data (6 Records)
INSERT INTO students (name, email, age, course) VALUES
('Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com', 21, 'Computer Science'),
('Bob Smith', 'bob@example.com', 19, 'Mathematics'),
('Charlie Brown', 'charlie@example.com', 22, 'Physics'),
('Diana Prince', 'diana@example.com', 20, 'Computer Science'),
('Ethan Hunt', 'ethan@example.com', 23, 'Engineering'),
('Fiona Gallagher', 'fiona@example.com', 18, 'Mathematics');


#Step 3: Read Data
Fetch all students: SELECT * FROM students;
Fetch students older than 20: SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;
Fetch only name and email columns: SELECT name, email FROM students;
Fetch students enrolled in a specific course: SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'Computer Science';

#Step 4: Update Data
Update the age of one student: UPDATE students SET age = 22 WHERE id = 1;
Update the course for all students in 'Mathematics' to 'Applied Math': UPDATE students SET course = 'Applied Math' WHERE course = 'Mathematics';

#Step 5: Delete Data
Delete one student using ID: DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 5;
Delete all students below a certain age: DELETE FROM students WHERE age < 20;
